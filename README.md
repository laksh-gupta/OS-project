We have tried to come up with a modified round robin and multilevel scheduling algorithm which uses statistical analysis to calculate the ideal time quanta for the process queue.  This will help in reducing the average waiting time, average turnaround time and reduce the number of context switch greatly compared to traditional round robin and priority algorithms.
